A Delightful though dark theme for unity monodevelop C#

This is my WIP syntax highlight scheme for Unity Monodevelop, only tested on 4.0.1.
Was it a nightmare to make? YES, was it worth it? definitely!

I really wish Unity Monodevelop would keep up with Xamarin which uses Json instead of XML schemes.

The scheme is based on Tim G. Thomas Visual studio scheme https://studiostyl.es/schemes/selenitic

Reason for this scheme?
I just couldn't stand looking at Monokai anymore.. it has been a favorite of mine for years and i still use it for Sublime text 3
but it is hideous in Monodevelop.. that orange color TT_TT.

Here is a taste of what it looks like:
